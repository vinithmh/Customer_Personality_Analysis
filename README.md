# Customer Personality Analysis

Welcome to the Customer Personality Analysis project repository. This project focuses on analyzing customer personalities and is built using XGBoost for classification tasks.

## Introduction

In this project, we analyze customer personality data to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. The analysis aims to provide valuable information for businesses seeking to understand their customers better, make data-driven decisions, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Getting Started

Before running the code in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Numpy

You can install the required packages by running:

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is provided in the repository. It contains information about customers, including demographic data, purchase history, and customer feedback. We perform data preprocessing and exploration to prepare it for analysis.

## Data Analysis

In the data analysis phase, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. We visualize the data and summarize key findings, helping us understand the characteristics of the customers and their interactions with the business.

## Model Building

We use the powerful XGBoost algorithm for classification tasks. The project includes hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. We evaluate the models using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and more.

## Results

The project's results highlight the accuracy of the final model and provide insights into customer personality classification. You'll find visualizations and performance metrics to help interpret the results.

## Model Saving

We provide code to save the trained XGBoost model, allowing you to use it in other applications. The saved model can be loaded with ease using the provided code.

## Repository Structure

data/: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
notebooks/: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building.
src/: Contains the Python source code files used in the project.
